		<p>Abstract: <em>The &ldquo;Destropic Principle&rdquo; is an argument  that establishes that every universe is equiprobable, and the possibility of  life is not a more special feature than any other. This opposes to the &ldquo;anthropic  principle&rdquo; when it is used to argue that there is a necessity for a divinity,  or multiple universes, in order to explain the configuration of our universe,  particularly, the capability of harboring life.</em></p>
		</font>
		<p>In  order to explain life in our universe, I will refute the &ldquo;anthropic principle&rdquo;  when it is used as an argument of the necessity of a deity or multiple  universes. I had already outlined this argument in my previous article on the  theme, The Anthropic Principle and The Jocaxian-Nothingness&rdquo; [1], but now I  intend to go a little deeper in the analysis. <br>
		  It  is not a very intuitive argument, and that is why we should use an analogy to  understand the idea behind. But first, I will summarize the anthropic principle  and how it is used by creationists and religious people in general to justify  God:</p>
		<p><strong>Introduction</strong><br>
		  The  physical laws, usually written in the form of mathematical equations, are  considered to be responsible for the characteristics of the universe and its  evolution in time. These laws, as we know today, are composed by equations in  which we can see some numerical constants (parameters). As examples we can  cite, among others: the speed of light, the mass of the electron, the electric  charge of the proton, etc. [2] <br>
		  It  is argued, without demonstration, that a little alteration (it is not clear  what would the magnitude of this alteration be) in any of these constants would  make the possibility of life in the universe not feasible. Those who claim that  also conclude that a universe created with physical laws generated at random  would hardly be able to trigger life.<br>
  <strong>Handicap</strong><br>
		  In  all fairness, we need to note that a universe with random laws does not need to  follow the pattern of physical laws we have in our universe, that is, the  mathematical equations that would define a randomly generated universe could be  totally different from the ones we have in our current universe (in principle it  would not even be necessary to describe such universes through mathematical  equations). That way, the parameters we have today would not apply to any of  the equations in this random universe. Thus, it is totally FALSE to claim that  all possible universes can be described maintaining the same equations of our  particular universe and varying only the constants present in them.<br>
		  However,  in order to refute the &ldquo;anthropic principle&rdquo; on its own support base, we should  consider true the fact that all possible universes keep the same structure of equations  as ours. We also assume that these equations are true, but knowing in advance  that this is not true, since there is a theoretical incompatibility between the  theory of relativity and the quantum mechanics. Besides that, we also suppose  that any alteration in one of the fundamental constants would make the  possibility of life impracticable, although no one has shown it yet.</p>
		<p><strong>An analogy</strong><br>
		  In  order to understand the idea of the &ldquo;Destropic Principle&rdquo;, we will make an  analogy with the real numbers of the equations which rule the several possible  universes.&nbsp; Suppose that each of the  possible universes can be represented by a real number between zero and ten. We  can justify that by thinking that we can concatenate all the fundamental  constants in a single numeric parameter.<br>
		  In  our analogy, the parameter &ldquo;4,22341&rdquo;,  for example, would represent an U1 universe, which would be different from an  U2 universe, represented by the parameter &ldquo;6,123333...&rdquo;, and so on.&nbsp; Thus, each of these numeric parameters would  completely define the characteristics of the universe represented by them.<br>
		  Suppose  there is a machine that randomly generates real numbers between zero and ten.  Each generated number would be the parameter that would define a universe. We  can see that the possibility of predicting what number the machine will generate  is very small, almost zero. However, the machine will certainly generate a  number.<br>
		  Suppose  our universe is represented by U1 (&ldquo;4,22341&rdquo;). Then we can ask: what is the  probability of the number of our universe being chosen, once there are infinite  possible numbers? There are infinite real numbers between zero and ten,  therefore it is almost impossible to foresee that the number &ldquo;4,22341&rdquo;, which is the  parameter that defines the characteristics of our universe, will be chosen.<br>
		  Thereby,  when the machine generates a number representing a parameter of the universe,  the answer to the question &ldquo;How probable would the generation of a universe  like ours be?&rdquo; will be &ldquo;As likely as the generation of any other specific  universe&rdquo;.</p>
		<p><strong>Equiprobable</strong><br>
		  In  our model of random generation of universes all universes are equiprobable,  since any real number between zero and ten would have the same probability of  being generated. No universe is more likely to be generated than the other. So,  whatever the number generated by the machine was, it would be as unlikely to be  predicted as any other number. We then conclude that our universe is so likely  to be generated as any other.</p>
		<p><strong>Life</strong><br>
		  However,  someone could retort:<br>
  &ldquo;-Our  universe is the only one where the possibility of life exists&rdquo;.<br>
		  The  possibility of life is a peculiarity of our universe. Any other generated  universe would also have its specific peculiarities. For example: maybe one of  them could be made of tiny colored crystal balls, the other could form elastic goos,  others, perfect spheres, and so on. If, for example, the generated universe  produced little blue crystal balls, then we could make the same exclamation:<br>
  &ldquo;-Only  this universe produces little glowing balls!&rdquo;<br>
		  Or:<br>
  &ldquo;Only  in this universe there is possibility of producing elastic goos!&rdquo;<br>
		  And  so on. For us, humans, life can be more important than little glowing balls, or  elastic goos, but this is only a human valuation. There is no logic reason to  suppose that a universe with life is more important than a universe that  produces little glowing crystal balls, or elastic goos.<br>
		  Therefore,  we cannot claim that our universe is special and unique, because it is as  special and unique as any other universe that was generated at random. All universes  would have their specific features, generated by their also unique physical  constants.</p>
		<p><strong>Another Formality</strong><br>
		  In  order to clarify this idea, we can redo our argument using another formality:<br>
		  Suppose  the universes are described by six fundamental constants (the exact number does  not matter, the following reasoning is for any number of constants).<br>
		  Thus,  any U universe could be defined by a system of equations that uses six basic  constants. We represent this dependence as follows:<br>
		  U=  U (A, B, C, D, E, F). <br>
		  Our  U1 universe in particular is described in that formality as:<br>
		  U1=  U (A1, B1, C1, D1, E1, F1) </p>
		<p>Now,  consider a U2 Universe with constants different from U1:<br>
		  U2  = U (A2, B2, C2, D2, E2, F2)<br>
		  As  U1, by definition, contains the parameters of our universe, it will generate a  universe that may harbor &ldquo;life&rdquo;, but cannot generate &ldquo;lofe&rdquo;. Similarly, U2 can  generate &ldquo;lofe&rdquo;, but cannot generate &ldquo;life&rdquo;. &ldquo;Lofe&rdquo; is a random feature of U2,  as the characteristic of being able to form a group of particles where the  density is exactly 0,12221 (a random number), for example. Only U2 can generate  &ldquo;lofe&rdquo;, and any change in the parameters would make the generation of &ldquo;lofe&rdquo;  not feasible.<br>
		  Of  course, the same way, another universe, U3, with other constants<br>
		  U3  = U (A3, B3, C3, D3, E3, F3) <br>
		  would  not make &ldquo;life&rdquo; feasible, nor &ldquo;lofe&rdquo;, but would make &ldquo;lufe&rdquo; viable.<br>
  &ldquo;lufe&rdquo;  is a physical condition that occurs when the particles are subject to the  regime of forces generated by the constants of U3 (A3&hellip;F3). Any change in one of  these constants would make &ldquo;lufe&rdquo; not viable.</p>
		<p>Note  that there is no INTRINSIC importance about the universe generating &ldquo;life&rdquo;,  &ldquo;lofe&rdquo;, or &ldquo;lufe&rdquo;. It does not make any difference to the generating machine or  to the universe itself. Especially because the universe and the random machine  do not have consciousness or desires. What differs to the machine is the value  of the fundamental constants, not what they will generate or not. For the  generating machine and even for the generated universe, it is irrelevant if it will  be able to harbor life, &ldquo;lofe&rdquo;, &ldquo;lufe&rdquo;, or present any other peculiarity. Each  universe has its own feature. If U1 allows &ldquo;life&rdquo;, it does not allow &ldquo;lofe&rdquo;, nor  &ldquo;lufe&rdquo;; if U2 allows &ldquo;lofe&rdquo;, it does not allow &ldquo;life&rdquo; nor &ldquo;lufe&rdquo;; if U3 allows  &ldquo;lufe&rdquo;, it does not allow &ldquo;life&rdquo;, nor &ldquo;lofe&rdquo;. It goes that way for any  generated universe.</p>
		<p>Thus,  we can see that our universe does not have anything special, once nothing is  intrinsically special. &ldquo;Life&rdquo; is as important as &ldquo;Lofe&rdquo; or &ldquo;Lufe&rdquo;. The universe  is not worried if &ldquo;lofe&rdquo; generates consciousness or not, nor if &ldquo;lufe&rdquo;  generates a cluster of an incredible yellow glow which would never exist in U1  or if &ldquo;lofe&rdquo; generates micro colored pyramids with their own indescribably  beautiful glow. That matters to humans, little egocentric beings of U1 that  care about &ldquo;life&rdquo;, maybe because they are alive.</p>
		<p>Thereby,  the probability of generating a universe that has &ldquo;lufe&rdquo; is equivalent to  another one that has &ldquo;life&rdquo; or &ldquo;lofe&rdquo;. There is nothing miraculous or magical  about our universe that makes it REALLY special. Therefore, there is no sense  in saying that the probability of our universe being that way is the work of  some deity. Whatever the generated universe was, its probability of having that  feature is exactly the same as the probability of our universe being exactly as  it is.</p>
		<div><br>
		  It is like choosing at random a real number between zero and ten. They  are all equally probable and difficult to be chosen. None is more or less  special than the others. </div>
