Jo&atilde;o Carlos Holland de Barcellos </p>
		</font>
		<p><strong><em>Jocaxian Theorem of First Cause  (JTFC)</em></strong><br>
		  <br>
		  The Jocaxian theorem of  First Cause establishes that:<br>
  <em>The first cause of all events that took place in a closed system (one that  is not influenced by events external to the system) is the randomization.</em><br>
  <br>
		  Proof:<br>
		  <br>
		  Let&rsquo;s use the concept of  time in which time is defined as a relationship between events. An event is a  change of state in the system. Therefore, time is not independent from whatever  happens. If, for example, no event takes place, that is, the state of the  system remains unaltered, time then disappears. Change is necessary so that  time can exist. If there is no change, there is no time.<br>
		  <br>
		  Randomization is the word  we use to say that there is unpredictability or that there are no causes. There  are two types of randomization: objective and subjective. In the subjective  randomization there are causes for the phenomenon, but they are either unknown  or we cannot describe them. In the objective randomization, which we will talk  about, the phenomenon occurs with no real causes, that is, its causes are  inexistent.<br>
		  <br>
		  The objective randomization  exists in our nature, in our universe. As an example, we can cite the moment of  decay of an electron in an atom: the electron can decay from a more energetic  orbit to a lower-energy one by liberating a photon. Such phenomenon is not  regulated by any physical law: it is considered by the quantum mechanics to be an  objectively random phenomenon. There is nothing, no rule that can determine <em>when</em> the electron will decay from its  orbit. Another example would be the creation and destruction of virtual  particles in the vacuum.<br>
		  <br>
		  First, in order to  demonstrate the theorem, we will prove that there is no infinite time in past,  that is, we cannot take the causes of the events to the infinite past and then  say that there has always been a cause that preceded a given effect. Thus, we  will use the <em>Kalam&rsquo;s Theorem</em>.<br>
		  <br>
		  The Kalam&rsquo;s Theorem  establishes that there is no infinite time in past. If, absurdly, there had  been any event occurred in an infinite time in past, then our current present  would take an infinite time to come, starting from that past. But what does &ldquo;an  infinite time to occur&rdquo; mean? An infinite time for something to occur means  that this thing will never occur. Thus, events occurred in an infinite time in  past imply that we cannot have our present, but this is an absurd thinking once  we are in the present! Then we can conclude that there has not been any event in  an infinite time in past. That means we can deduce another important corollary:  time had to have a beginning, necessarily.</p>
		<p>As there is no infinite  time in past and time had to have a beginning, the first occurring event had no  previous cause, that is, it was a random event. And the theorem is proved.</p>
		<p><strong><em>Time Leakage Jocaxian Theorem (TLJT)</em></strong><br>
		  <br>
		  The Time Leakage Jocaxian  Theorem establishes that:<br>
  <em>If two systems are not isolated from each other and time exists in one  of them, then time will exist in the other as well.</em><br>
  <br>
		  Proof:<br>
		  		  Time is the relationship between  events. If time occurs in one of the systems and they are not isolated from  each other, then these events can be also correlated from the other system.  Therefore, the first system, in which time exists, can be a time counter for  the second system. Thus, there will be time in the second system too.<br>
		  		  <br>
		  We can use both theorems to  argue against the existence of God: God cannot be timeless as this would  violate the Time Leakage Jocaxian theorem. If there is time in our universe and  it is not isolated from God, then time also exists to God. Besides that, by the  JTFC there is no necessity for God to generate the first phenomenon. This  refutes <em>Saint</em> Thomas Aquinas&rsquo; argument, which says that the movement requires a first engine  that would be God. Also, it refutes the idea of a forever existent God, once it  would contradict the corollary of the beginning of time.</p>

		<p><strong><em>The Existence Theorem</em></strong><br>
		  <br>
		  We will prove that there is  an ultimate reality, a reality that does not depend on any interpretation of  any being to exist.<br>
		  In this text, we define  reality &ndash; real existence &ndash; as events and/or facts that do not depend on  interpretation (=thought, imagination, dream or processing) of any being to  exist.<br>
		  <br>
            <strong>Demonstration</strong><br>
		  <br>
		  We will begin our proofing with  &ldquo;something 1&rdquo;, that can be any object being observed e.g. an apple, or even the  thinking itself: consciousness. <br>
		  I observe something 1.<br>
		  If this something 1 is the  reality, the proofing finishes.<br>
		  If Not:<br>
		  This something 1 is just an  interpretation (or imagination) of a being 1 and, in fact, does not exist in  the reality. But this interpretation in itself of something 1, done by the supposed  being 1, is also something 2.<br>
		  If this something 2 is  reality, then our proofing finishes.<br>
		  If Not:<br>
		  Something 2 is just an  interpretation of a being 2 whose interpretation, in itself, is something 3.<br>
		  If something 3 exists as a  reality, the proofing finishes.<br>
		  If Not:<br>
		  This something 3 is just an  interpretation of a being 3, which we call something 4.<br>
		  Thus, in a generic way, we  have:<br>
		  If something (i) exists as  reality, the proofing finishes.<br>
		  If not:<br>
		  Something (i) is only an  interpretation (or imagination) of a being (i) whose interpretation in itself  we call something (i+1).<br>
		  If something (i+1) exists  in reality the proofing finishes.<br>
		  <br>
		  And so on. This way, if the  interpretation never corresponds to a real existence, we would have an infinite  recursion, which would be illogical. It would be something like a dream of a  dream of a dream of a dream&hellip; infinitely. So, in order not to have this infinite  cycle, we must have, at some point, an end to this recursion. That means that  some of the &ldquo;something (i)&rdquo; have a real existence, that is, it is not an  interpretation. And then we prove our theorem: &ldquo;<strong><em>I think, therefore, something  exists!&rdquo;</em></strong></p>
		<p><strong>Examples:</strong><br>
		  <br>
		  I see a red crow. The &ldquo;red  crow&rdquo; can be real, and if it is not, my interpretation of it can. Otherwise, a  being can be imagining (or dreaming) that &ldquo;I&rdquo; am imagining that I see a &ldquo;red  crow&rdquo;.<br>
		  <br>
		  Another example would be a  virtual universe: there are beings that do not really exist; they are simulated  in a computer. These beings observe something. What they observe is not real  either: it is virtual. Also, the beings themselves and their dreams do not  exist: they are virtual. Therefore, their interpretations do not exist.<br>
		  However, the computer which  interprets them in this example is real, and its &ldquo;imagination&rdquo; (= its  processing) is real, once it is what generates the virtual universe, the  virtual beings and its imagination. That is:<br>
		  What the virtual being  observes is not real; it is a simulation of the computer.<br>
		  The virtual being is not  real either; it is simulated and depends on the processing of a computer.<br>
		  The interpretation of the  virtual being is not real either, once it depends on the processing of a  computer.<br>
		  The interpretation of the  computer (= its processing) which produces the virtual being and what it  imagines, in this example, would be real.</p>
		<p><strong>Refuting Descartes</strong><br>
		  <br>
		  That means that &ldquo;I think,  therefore I exist&rdquo; (&ldquo;Cogito, ergo sum&rdquo;) from Descartes can be untrue once the  thinking being, as demonstrated in the example above, can be unreal. However,  as proved before, there must be some level of interpretation in which at least  the interpretation itself is real.<br>
		  <br>
		  By the &ldquo;Occam&rsquo;s razor&rdquo;, as  long there is no contrary evidence, we have consider the lower interpretative  level a reality. If I observe something 1, this something 1 may exist.<br>
		  <br>
  <strong>Corollary: There is a real being.</strong><br>
  <br>
		  As a corollary of the  system we can also claim that if I observe something, there must be some &ldquo;being&rdquo;  that has a real existence, i.e. this being itself is not an interpretation.<br>
		  Proof:<br>
		  As we proved that there is  an interpretation that is real, that is, an interpretation that does not depend  on the interpretation of another being to exist, then the being that interprets  must exist as well. If this &ldquo;being&rdquo; which does the real interpretation did not  exist, that is, if it was the interpretation of another being, then its interpretation  would not be real, as it would depend on this other being. Therefore, the real  existence of a being is necessary so that a real interpretation can exist.</p>
