		<p><strong>Abstract: </strong>Occam&rsquo;s Razor (OR) establishes that one must eliminate  &ldquo;unnecessary&rdquo; hypothesis from theories. This essay intends to establish some  rules that conceptualise the &ldquo;no-necessity&rdquo; criterion in OR. A new version of  the classic Inductivism is also proposed and later used to solve this problem.</p>

		<p><strong>1-Introduction</strong></p>
		<p>Occam&rsquo;s Razor (OR)  [1] is a logical-philosophic criterion used virtually in every knowledge  acquisition process as well as in our everyday life.</p>
		<p>Succinctly, OR  establishes that we must eliminate unnecessary hypothesis from our theories. The  criterion by itself is almost a tautology, that is, an absolute logical truth,  since the hypothesis understood as unnecessary are by definition not necessary  to the theory. That way OR must be considered an incontestable truth. Therefore,  the whole problem is not really in OR, but in the criteria concerning the  &ldquo;unnecessity&rdquo; of the hypothesis.</p>
		<p>Let us use some  examples to exemplify. Consider the following theories:</p>
		<p>1a- For a car to  move, it must have fuel.</p>
		<p>1b- For a car to  move, it must have fuel, and its occupants must pray the &ldquo;Our Father&rdquo;.</p>
		<p>2a- For cough syrup  to work the patient must ingest it.</p>
		<p>2b- For cough syrup  to work the patient must ingest it and, besides that, sing &ldquo;hula-hula&rdquo; while  turning around for three times.</p>
		<p>This way we could  include an infinity of other craziest as possible hypothesis in each of our  theories.</p>
		<p>Similarly, the  reader knows he does not have to recite a children&rsquo;s poem each time he drinks a  glass of water in order to avoid pouring water out of the glass. That shows OR  is present in our everyday life, even in an imperceptible way.</p>
		<p>But how should we  know whether a hypothesis is really unnecessary?</p>
		<p>How should we  know we actually do not have to pray the &ldquo;Our Father&rdquo; for the car to move, nor  turn around singing the &ldquo;hula-hula&rdquo; for some medicine to be effective, or  recite a children&rsquo;s poem so water does not shed from the glass?</p>
		<p>Indeed, all these  apparently absurd and clearly unnecessary hypothesis given in the examples  could be absolutely necessary in some other universe, or even in our own  universe since the moment the reader finishes this sentence. That is, we cannot  guarantee that the laws of physics have changed and those hypotheses that were before  seen as absurd are now totally necessary.</p>
		<p>In short, what is the criterion of necessity (or not)  of a hypothesis or any theory?</p>
		<p>Before we answer to that important question, let us  create a new theoretical framework: &ldquo;The New Inductivism&rdquo;.</p>
		<p><strong>2-  The New Inductivism</strong><br>
		  The main process to connect our minds to the external  world and elaborate theories about our universe, that is, the way we acquire  knowledge is known as &ldquo;induction process&rdquo;.</p>
		<p>The induction process, or Inductivism, establishes  that experiments, occurrences or events that always have the same results will  probably have the same results under the same conditions. And the more times  these results repeat, that is, the more favourable observations about the  hypothesis or theory are obtained, the more reliable the hypothesis or theory  is.</p>
		<p><strong>2.1-  Hypothesis Formation</strong></p>
		<p>Obviously, the simple observation of phenomena  repetition does not produce by itself any theory. To exemplify, a monkey can  observe some repetitive phenomena for its whole life as &ldquo;the Sun rises in the  East&rdquo;, and it will not formulate a theory about that.</p>
		<p>Therefore, the inductive process does not elaborate  finished theories. Instead, it provides us with important clues so that we or  some kind of processing can create hypothesis or theories about reality. That  way, it is perfectly possible that different people elaborate different  theories or hypothesis using the same data obtained from inductive observation.</p>
		<p><strong>2.2-  First Results</strong></p>
		<p>From the inductive process we create the basic  hypothesis that our universe is logical, that is, it works logically according  to the aristotelic logic. And also, the laws of Physics must be stable. These  first results give us the trust that our universe must not have changed its  laws so that water would pour out from our glasses if we did not recite some  children&rsquo;s poem!</p>
		<p>The Induction process is very criticized by many  scientists and science philosophers under the true statement that this process  not always produces correct results.</p>
		<p>However, that will rarely happen under the &ldquo;New  Inductivism&rdquo;. There is an inductive hierarchy in the New Inductivism. This  hierarchy establishes that new inductive rules must be subordinate to  pre-existent inductive rules. </p>
		<p>Thus, there is a law hierarchy based on more basic and  reliable inductive processes, where some have more power and privilege than  others. That way, it is not possible to interrupt an inductive hierarchy  without a good reason for that.<br>
		  So a new inductive rule can only be considered  satisfactory if it does not break the hierarchy of stronger inductive rules.</p>
		<p>In this manner, the &ldquo;New Inductivism&rdquo; can be defined  as the classical Inductivism linked to subordination of an inductive hierarchy.</p>
		<p><strong>2.3-Inductive  Hierarchy</strong></p>
		<p>It is possible to create an inductive hierarchy in a  decreasing degree of power, in a way that a law with a less elevated level of power  must not go against the superior hierarchical levels. Our inductive hierarchy  can be defined in a decreasing level of importance in the following way:</p>
		<ol>
		  <li>The most basic and powerful inductive rule is that our universe is  logical. No illogical event has ever been observed. We can suppose then, by  induction, that the universe follows logic. Any theory that goes against this  first rule must, in principle, be considered false.</li>
		  </ol>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<ol>
		  <li>The laws of Physics form the second class of our inductive hierarchy.  Obviously they must not oppose the first level of hierarchy. And, for that  reason, the laws of Physics can use mathematics, which is totally based on  logic. The laws of Physics are created by observation of the most extense set  of observations on regularities of our universe. For that reason, they must be  among the most reliable rules built by mankind. The power of these rules  resides in the fact that they must be verified, direct or indirectly, in every  observable universe and they should not be limited to our planet, nor even to  our solar system.</li>
		  </ol>
		<ol>
		  <li>The laws of Chemistry could form the third level of our hierarchy.</li>
		  </ol>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<ol>
		  <li>The laws of Biology, the forth level.</li>
		  </ol>
		<ol>
		  <li>The other norms, rules or laws must not oppose the theories of the  classification above, unless they are exhaustingly verified.</li>
		  </ol>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>It is possible to notice that <em>the degree of strength in the inductive hierarchy is based on the  extensibility, that is, the quantity of favourable observations in space and  time in which the theory approaches in a favourable way. </em>Inductive rules of  short range in space and time have fewer favourable cases than large range ones.  For that reason, such rules must be subordinate to the most general ones that  had been tested and, because of that, present a greater level of reliability.</p>
		<p><strong>2.4-  Inductivist Response</strong></p>
		<p>Now, with that classification, we can rebut the  argument against the inductive principle: &ldquo;The Sun Rising Argument&rdquo;. It says  that if we use the inductive process about the rising of the Sun every morning  we will create a law establishing that:</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Today and always, every 24 hours the sun will rise in  the East and set in the West&rdquo;</p>
		<p>However, we can &ldquo;rebut&rdquo; (*) this argument by showing  that it goes against the inductive principles of the second hierarchy (the laws  of Physics), since according to these laws, the hydrogen of the Sun will end in  four billion years and our star will explode. That way, one day, unfortunately,  the Sun will not rise anymore and therefore this principle cannot be considered  satisfactory.</p>
		<p><strong>2.5-  &ldquo;Inductivist Refutationism&rdquo;</strong></p>
		<p>We must make it clear that the inductive process, <em>as any other process</em>, does not  necessarily lead to the truth. Something that has always been stable and  reached the same results can have these results changed by some new condition  or some new observation. We will never be sure about the ultimate truth of the  universe.</p>
		<p>That way, it is natural that a law or rule created by  an inductive process stops being valid in case a new observation &ldquo;rebuts&rdquo; (*)  the inductive regularity. In that case, evidently, the induction does not exist  anymore, since this refutatory event did not pass through induction. The  induction, in that case, was broken and therefore it is not an induction, it is  not valid. We can clearly notice the brakeage of the inductivity by an  unfavourable event as analogue to &ldquo;popperian refutationism&rdquo;, where evidence  contrary to a theory is its own rebuttal element.</p>
		<p><strong>2.6-  The Deductive Hypothetical Method</strong></p>
		<p>The Deductive- Hypothetical Method (DHM), in which  hypothesis and theories are released to be later tested, does not go against  the inductive method. If not, see:</p>
		<p>In DHM a theory (or hypothesis) &ndash; not necessarily of  inductive basis &ndash; is proposed. From this theory we can use logic and verify the  consequences that it causes. If any observation &ldquo;refutes&rdquo; (*) the consequence  of this theory or this theory itself, then the theory will be &ldquo;refuted&rdquo; (*). But  clearly if the consequence of a theory is &ldquo;refuted&rdquo;, then the theory that  originated it will also be refuted, since the strongest inductivist rule is the  logical one, and by logic (more specifically by &ldquo;modus tollens&rdquo;) if the  consequent is false then necessarily the antecedent will also be.<br>
		  That way, we can verify that if DHM shows some case  which results in a &ldquo;refutation&rdquo; of the consequence of a theory, this fact will  also break the Inductivism of the theory that originated it. The opposite is  also clearly true: a flaw in Inductivism by an observation would also &ldquo;refute&rdquo;  (*) the theory.</p>
		<p><strong>2.7-  The Evidence</strong></p>
		<p>An evidence is an observation, fact or event that  corroborates or not a theory. The inductive method, in general, elaborates its  theories from evidence, that is, inductivity has its basis on reality as a  starting point. Thus, Inductivism has advantages over other creation processes.<br>
		  It is important to notice that theories or hypothesis  generated by creation processes that do not come from empirical observation will  also need to go through some kind of validation process, that is, a sequence of  tests and empirical observations will also be necessary for the theories to be  reliable.</p>
		<p>Obviously in principle a newly created non-inductive  theory, and yet with no favourable evidence can be true, while another that has  been tested can be false.&nbsp; However, until  the observations or experiments decrease or enhance the reliability of the  theories, we must credit the theories that have already been through some  observational test. In that case, inductive-based theories would have the  initial advantage and therefore must <em>be  taken as more reliable than the non-inductive ones</em>.</p>
		<p><strong>2.8  &ndash; Degree of &ldquo;Inductive Reliability&rdquo;</strong></p>
		<p>As a particular case, but not less important, we could  say that a theory that does not have any favourable evidence, that is, the  number of favourable inductions is zero, must have in principle, zero  reliability.<br>
		  As the amount of favourable evidence (quantity of  valid inductive events) increases, the inductive reliability degree must also  increase.</p>
		<p><strong>3-  Necessity Criterion in Occam&rsquo;s Razor</strong></p>
		<p>From this new theoretical base we can now answer the question  in the beginning of this essay: </p>
		<p><em>What  is the necessity (or not) criterion of any hypothesis or theory in OR?&rdquo;</em></p>
		<p>The answer to this question can be given according to  the <em>&ldquo;inductive reliability&rdquo;</em> degree  (IR) presented by the hypothesis concerning the theory. The lower the inductive  reliability (IR), the more unnecessary the hypothesis is.</p>
		<p>Take the following theory as an example:<br>
		  1b- For a car to move, it must  have fuel, and its occupants must pray the &ldquo;Our Father&rdquo;.</p>
		<p>The hypothesis of the necessity for the prayer for the  car to move has a very low IR and therefore can be considered unnecessary. But  in case our universe changes or the fact happens in another universe, this  hypothesis can have a high degree of IR and then be a hypothesis that is not  unnecessary. It all depends on associated inductive reliability.<br>
		  <br>
		  (*) &ldquo;Refute&rdquo; is between inverted commas because,  according to P.I.F [3],  it is never possible to know whether an observation is true or not. Therefore,  it is never possible to know whether something was refuted or not.</p>
