		<p><em>Genetic Philosophy </em><br>
		  <br>
The roots of Genismo date back about 20 years ago,  around the 80&rsquo;s. By that time, I had created what I call &ldquo;Genetic Philosophy&rdquo;  [1]. It was a simple doctrine, based on the finding that we are not able to  change our instincts since they are genetically codified; however, it would be  possible to do so through our culture and beliefs, which are cultural products  and therefore can be substituted.<br>
 <br>
 It was  clear to me at that time that much of our suffering was due to the dichotomy  between our values like religiosity, ethics and moral on one side, and on the  other to our instincts, wills and wishes. Then the best thing we could do would  be to adequate our culture to our biology as much as possible, not the  opposite. <br>
		</p>
		<p>	    The opposite would be biologically impossible. Putting our beliefs  and culture against our biological imperative could only produce more suffering  and unhappiness. <br>
		  <br>
		  Let  us note in passing that the Freudian theory of sexuality can be seen as one of  the facets of my old &ldquo;genetic philosophy&rdquo; since sexuality plays an important  instinctive role and, therefore, we could expect that a violent repression to  those instincts would cause suffering or various disorders.<br>
		  <br>
		  Later,  around 1990, still intrigued by man&rsquo;s biological nature, I read the fantastic  book <em>The Selfish Gene</em>, by Richard  Dawkins. The book shows clearly that all living beings evolved through natural  selection &ldquo;in order to&rdquo; perpetuate their genes. &ldquo;In order to&rdquo; is between inverted  commas because it is a metaphoric notation: organisms do not really have a  conscious objective of perpetuating their genes. They act in this way instinctively,  through impulses or reactions that are pre-coded in their nervous system. These  reactions can be pretty complex, since only organisms (herein understood as a  set of genes) that can transmit their genes to future generations remain in the <em>gene pool</em> of the population. The ones  that are not able to do so for some reason do not have their genes preserved; therefore,  their characteristics are eliminated. That way, it is like the living organisms  had an intention to act in compliance with their genetic perpetuation.</p>
		
		<p>We  must notice that the instinctive value of life, that is, survival itself, is  nothing more than one of the many features of genetic preservation. Before the  reader thinks that Genismo is all about offspring, as many do when in contact  with the doctrine for the first time, I must say that that would be a crude  simplification. It will make all the difference to remember that our genes are  not only in our bodies, as we will see. <br>
		  <br>
            <em>&ldquo;Genes created us and we must serve them&rdquo;</em></p>
		<p>Well,  Dawkins&rsquo; <em>Selfish Gene</em> showed clearly  through innumerous examples from the natural world that living beings were  programmed by natural selection to perpetuate their genes. To perpetuate genes  means making them survive for as long as possible through generations.  Actually, organisms could be seen as carcasses, biological devices or &ldquo;<em>Survival machines&rdquo;</em>, as it was addressed  by the evolutionary biologists at the time, that were &ldquo;made to&rdquo; survive and  pass their genes on to the next generation.</p>
		<p>In  the book, maybe for prudence, Dawkins did not use human examples to demonstrate  this point of view and, for my own luck, he stated we should go against our  genes! In his words:<br>
            <em>&ldquo;Let us  understand what our own selfish genes are up to, because we may then at least  have a chance to upset their designs, something that no other species has ever  aspired to do.&rdquo;</em></p>
		<p>So  that the reader can start to understand this gene-<em>perpetuative</em> paradigm, it is important to notice that animals  supposedly irrational do not undertake battles and bloodthirsty mortal wars  against their own species and, in a surprisingly way, it is rare that one of  them dies in individual fights, like territorial disputes or because of females  in heat. Even in the search for food ad hunger situations, very rarely species  will eat another member of its own species. Why is that so? Is not survival the  biggest biological imperative of all?<br>
		  <br>
		  That  happens because the biological nature of living beings is centered in perpetuation  of genes of shared organisms, not individual ones. If the biological paradigm  was only sheer survival, no female would risk its life to save its descendants  from danger. The animals would hunt and eat their own species and offspring  when hungry. But that rarely happens. What happens is that the supposedly  &ldquo;wild&rdquo; animals follow their genes closely, more closely than humans. Humans  have consciousness and a mighty brain unfortunately capable of betraying our  genes. That happens not only through wars against our fellow creatures, using  famous &ldquo;mass destruction weapons&rdquo;, but also against ourselves and as a  consequence, endangering our own happiness.<br>
		  <br>
  <em>&ldquo;Happiness is to walk the path of genetic  perpetuation&rdquo;</em><br>
  <br>
		  Thus,  my old 'genetic philosophy' evolved to Genismo sometime after I read &ldquo;The Selfish  Gene&rdquo; and realized we should avoid acting against our genes and start acting  for them. Obviously, we should be restricted to some ethical dominion, but yet  we would have an ample playing field that would minimize our suffering, give us  a meaning to life and a new kind of immortality, not anymore based on  illusions, but on real entities: the genes.<br>
		  <br>
		  Genismo,  during a phase that lasted from 1990 until April 2003, established that we  should assume culturally our biological condition of &ldquo;Gene-Perpetuator Machine&rdquo;  and act to perpetuate them. As a result of such actions, which I called  gene-perpetuative actions, we would maximize our happiness, since we would  reduce culture x instinct conflicts and integrate our culture to our deepest  biological essence.<br>
		  <br>
  &ldquo;<em>Our genes are our most precious assets&rdquo;</em><br>
  <br>
		  Of  course the acceptance of our &ldquo;gene perpetuator machines&rdquo; intrinsic condition is  not trivial: it imposes changes to our old values, some perhaps based on  religion, and changing inveterate beliefs and values is undoubtedly the most  difficult task in the world. But the doctrine establishes clearly that our most  valuable asset is our genes and if we want to maximize happiness without corrupting  truth, we must accept it.<br>
		  <br>
		  It  is important to highlight that our genes are not only in our individual bodies,  but spread all over humanity, as well as other species. We share the largest  part of our genes with our descendants and relatives, but the difference with  other members of the same species is not that big. We share about 86% of  identical genes (not chromosomes) with our children and about 68% of identical  genes with any other person.<br>
		  <br>
		  This  genetic sharing should provide us, in a cultural value level, acknowledgement  and acceptance of other beings as part of us. That way, acceptance of Genismo  could (and would) sponsor a bigger altruism in relation to our choices and  actions. Thinking that our consciousness is us, our essence, causes an increase  in human selfishness. This selfishness occurs because usually consciousness is  understood and accepted as something individual and, differently from genes,  something that cannot be shared. <br>
		  <br>
		  We must remember that selfishness of genes  does not necessarily imply selfishness in behavior. Most of the times, the  opposite happens: consider, as an example a mother, not necessarily human, that  risks her own life in order to save her offspring&rsquo;s. This altruistic behavior in  relation to her offspring was produced by &ldquo;selfishness&rdquo; of her genes that  &ldquo;want&rdquo; to survive and perpetuate, and led to an altruistic behavior. There are  many other types of genetic altruism (instinctive) with members of the same  species but not directly related. <br>
		  <br>
            <em>&ldquo;God does not exist and the only way to transcend  death is through genes.&rdquo;</em><br>
            <br>
		  Genismo  is a branch of atheism and is committed to science and truth. For that reason,  generally, beliefs not linked to reality such as religion, mysticism, esoterism  and other types of religion or pseudo-science lacking factual evidence are not  considered beneficial. Especially deistic religions are seen by Genismo as  alienating and dangerous memes, since their followers usually have a distorted  way of seeing the world that sometimes may lead to contradictions, unfairness  and unhappiness.<br>
		  <br>
		  The  genists &ndash; Genismo followers &mdash; must be tolerant with the infected by religious  memes (believers), since they know these believers had generally had their  brains infected when young by powerful and sometimes irresistible memetic  genes. As these memes, through faith, lead the individual to a continuous and  persistent acceptance of contradictions (implicit in those religions), it is  extremely difficult to make them notice that those contradictions should imply  the falsehood of their set of premises (beliefs).<br>
		  <br>
		  Immortality  through genes reinforces our gene-perpetuative actions and is also a form of  happiness Genismo offers. However, as genes are real entities and souls are  not, the feeling of immortality through genes is a belief with factual support.  Thus we see Genismo as a generator of two distinct sources of happiness: the  first, the most pragmatic one, brings happiness by reducing cultural conflicts  (memes x genes) and breaking the dichotomy between culture and biology,  therefore leading the individual to greater body-mind integration. The second  genist source of happiness is of a more &ldquo;elevated&rsquo; level, perhaps ideological:  it comes from the feeling of immortality through genes and gives life a  transcendental sense without appealing to false illusions.<br>
		  <br>
            <em>&ldquo;Genist Ethics is Scientific Meta-Ethics&rdquo;</em><br>
            <br>
            Genismo  leads individuals to value their genes and make them act in a way they will  consciously want to perpetuate them. That is the &ldquo;reason&rdquo; why we evolved, and Genismo  reinforces that that is also the reason we should live for. <strong>This way Genismo transforms a biological  goal into a cultural one. </strong>It unifies culture and biology. <br>
            <br>
            This new way to  see ourselves helps us integrate with our unchangeable essence that is our  genetic programming.<br>
            Nevertheless,  there may be gene-perpetuative possibilities that, although can bring happiness  or pleasure to their executor, may provoke more suffering and unhappiness to  other individuals, decreasing total happiness in the group, something that goes  against the principles of SME. In that case, those possible actions must be  avoided, since Genismo is restricted to SME dominion. <br>
            <br>
            We must therefore be  always alert and not lose sight of the genist goal: happiness. Although Genismo  does not yet have a detailed and explicit ethics code, ethical restrictions to  our actions must necessarily be based on &ldquo;scientific meta-ethics&rdquo;: each  individual&rsquo;s happiness is limited to the happiness of the group. That is, an  individual in the group must not enhance its own happiness at the expense of overall  happiness of the group. Total happiness prevails over individual happiness.<br>
            <br>
            <em>&ldquo;We are our genes&rdquo;</em><br>
            <br>
            In  April 2003, Genismo evolved again: it was becoming each time clearer to me that  our consciousness was not our essence, but our genes. Genismo used to treat  &ldquo;us&rdquo; and &ldquo;our genes&rdquo; differently. We treated our genes as &ldquo;them&rdquo;. We should  serve them and live for them. Implicitly we were privileging our consciousness  as our &ldquo;true self&rdquo;. From that date on, not anymore. Our consciousness, as our  arms, stomach, eyes and nails must be seen as appendages of our true self: our  genes.<br>
            <br>
		  Although  our consciousness apparently [2] has control of our actions, it is a result of  a small part of our brain processing; maybe even of a minute area of our  brains. Thus, it is more reasonable even physically to think that we are our  genes, since differently from our consciousness they permeate virtually all  cells of our body: from the toes to the nucleus of each of our neurons.<br>
		  <br>
		  However,  the dictatorship of consciousness has made its roots very deep. There will  still be time until this new paradigm reflects on our colloquial language, and  because of that we must be comprehensive while we still treat genes as &ldquo;them&rdquo;  and our consciousness as &ldquo;us&rdquo;, even because we would not be understood by the  ones that do not know Genismo. But a genist would know that when we say we are  struggling to perpetuate our genes, we must understand we are struggling for  our own immortality.<br>
		  <br>
		  There  is more than one way to reach Genismo. One of them is through Scientific  Meta-Ethics (SME): happiness is maximized in the pleasure centers in the brain  that produce it when the organism acts according to is evolutionary  programming, that is, in a way to perpetuate its genes. Another way is through  study of life evolution. The following text, one of the firsts I wrote  concerning this new paradigm, shows how Genismo can be understood through  neodarwinian study of life evolution.</p>
		<p><strong>Hierarchized Genismo</strong><br>
		  <br>
		  Genismo  is a meme that has happiness as a goal. Happiness is not only pleasure, but the  addition of pleasure (and suffering) proportional to its duration on time.  Suffering decreases the value of happiness while pleasure increases it [1].<br>
		  By  the theory of evolution and natural selection process, we know that living  beings evolved *as* if they had the unconscious and instinctive goal of  perpetuating their genes, that is: maximizing their &ldquo;gene-perpetuation&rdquo;.<br>
		  <br>
		  There  is no transcendental reason for living beings to act this way. That happens  because the genes that are present today are exactly those that were able to  adapt their bearers to preserve them until the present moment.<br>
		  The  genes that did not make their bearers perpetuate them, that is, were not able  to make the organisms (phenotypes) that carried them pass them on to the next  generations, perished. Those genes are not among us any longer. Therefore we  are all living descendents of the first replicant (&ldquo;the primordial gene&rdquo;),  which originated life about four billion years ago and was successful to  survive through times [2].<br>
		  <br>
		  For  that reason, the base of evolutionary psychology, the science that studies the  behavior and social structure of living beings is based on the  &ldquo;gene-perpetuative&rdquo; paradigm.<br>
		  <br>
  <em>But how do genes make their bearers (us) act &ldquo;in a way  to&rdquo; perpetuate them?&rdquo;</em></p>
		<p><strong>Evolution and Consciousness</strong><br>
		  Genes  instigate their organisms to act in a &ldquo;gene-perpetuative&rdquo; way, as:</p>
		<ol>
		  <li><em>Rigid and biologically codified mechanisms.</em></li>
		  </ol>
		<p>That  way, for instance, a plant does not need to think or feel it has to turn its  leaves towards the sun in order to receive light: internal mechanisms turn the  leaves in the direction of sunlight captivation. They execute this task  automatically. Fructification or seed launching are also automatically done by  the genetic regulation of the plant, with no help of any nervous system.</p>
		<ol>
		  <li><em>Hyper primitive instincts</em></li>
		  </ol>
		<p>In  beings that own nervous system there are mechanisms codified by genes through  mental algorithms (instincts) that instigate the organism to behave and act almost  mechanically, without the need to think about its actions. Those algorithms are  in general placed on the base of the brain, in the reptilian system. For  example:&nbsp; breathing control, pupil  dilatation in the dark, bristle of hair when cold, etc. The increase in the  ability to survive and reproduce is a feature that helps genetic survival.</p>
		<ol>
		  <li><em>Instincts that generate wishes or wills.</em></li>
		  </ol>
		<p>Other  instincts (=mental algorithms genetically codified to solve specific problems)  do not produce directly an action in the organism, but impulses, wishes and  wills, in a way that the organism itself, through other instincts or use of  reason and logics, will decide the best way to satisfy them. In general, those  mental algorithms that generate wishes and feelings are situated in the brain  limbic system. Examples: anger, love, jealousy, etc.</p>
		<ol>
		  <li><em>Reward mechanisms.</em> </li>
		  </ol>
		<p>Reward  mechanisms are studied by a science area known as &ldquo;behaviorism&rdquo;. Those internal  mechanisms make the organism learn (through usage of memory) through pain (or  pleasure) that an action is harmful to the genes (or beneficial to them). For  instance: putting a hand on fire causes pain and pain is a sign and a way to  learn that this act is harmful to the genes. Eating sweet substances is  pleasant because, in general, they offer energy to the body and that is  beneficial to the genes.</p>
		<ol>
		  <li><em>Epigenetic  Rules</em></li>
		  </ol>
		<p>&ldquo;Epigenetic  rules&rdquo; are improved forms of instinct. They are basically mental algorithms  that are not used while not necessary. But when triggered and put to action  they may activate a lot of internal mechanisms. Such instincts are not  triggered without a previous evaluation of their necessity in relation to the  environment. For example: being slapped on the face may trigger anger, or may  be caress display in some culture. The same sensorial stimulus may activate  others like anger and affection or not, depending on the context.<br>
		  <br>
		  Those  instinctive mechanisms developed through natural selection since thousands,  even millions of years ago. However, the environment changes more rapidly than  the genes adapt to it. That can make them lag behind environmental changes,  what causes risk of death or extinction of species. For that reason, the genes made  the epigenetic rules flexible through natural selection, what led to the  appearance of the neocortex: the thirst for reason.<br>
		  <br>
		  With  this new human brain layer, almost every stimuli that before would trigger  instincts that make the body act immediately do not do that anymore. The  instinctive actions are blocked and, before being triggered, they go through a  rational/environmental evaluation: consciousness.<br>
		  <br>
		  One  of the functions of consciousness is therefore blocking instinctive actions and  evaluating the best answer. With a more efficient response to environmental  stimuli, reason naturally took place of instinct in control of actions. For  that reason we (sometimes) are able not to hit a person in case he/she annoys  us.<br>
		  <br>
		  Obviously,  the genes that created this brain layer only survived because this strategy was  more efficient to perpetuate the genes of the organism. Why? Because we are  here!<br>
		  If  the genes that created reason and consciousness had been less efficient to  perpetuate we would not be here with all this conscious and rational apparatus  in the head.<br>
		  <br>
		  With  this new neurological apparatus in the brain, a new level of gene-perpetuation  appears:</p>
		<ol>
		  <li><em>Absorption of memes.</em></li>
		  </ol>
		<p>As  a consequence of the speed of environmental changes and genetic inability to  create mental algorithms specific to each different environmental situation,  the genes created a more flexible structure &ndash; the neocortex- which can block  instincts and analyze the best solution through reason instead of responding immediately.  The ability to store memes in brain memory allowed knowledge to be used without  having to be reinvented.<br>
		  Since  then, the culture and the brain have advanced and evolved a lot. That allowed  us to land on the moon, create medicines and become one of the species with the  biggest evolutionary success on the planet.<br>
		  <br>
  <strong>Ideological Pleasure</strong><br>
  <br>
		  The  ability to absorb memes made the ideological pleasure possible.<br>
		  The  ideological Pleasure is what we feel when we act in accordance to the ideology  (memes) we believe is true. It has probably originated from the necessity of  cohesion in territorial disputes and tribal wars in our evolutionary past. For  instance, if we belong to a soccer team, religion, club, city, country, etc, we  should feel pleasure when we act in benefit of the group or the institution we  belong to. This pleasure is based on the fact that people that are close to us  and share the same interests should probably share more similar genes; thus,  helping them is also a way to help our genes, since we probably share more  genes with them than with strangers.</p>
		<p><strong>Genes and Happiness</strong><br>
		  <br>
		  It  is important to notice that the usage of instincts, epigenetic rules and reason  itself had a &ldquo;purpose&rdquo; [4]: those mechanisms evolved while benefiting  gene-perpetuation. But these organisms are not really interested in  gene-perpetuation (actually, not even the genes are)! These organisms want more  and more pleasure and less suffering and pain. So, all <em>usage</em> of internal brain mechanisms to solve problems means only  more sophisticated ways of solving problems to increase pleasure and decrease  pain for the longest period of time possible, that is:<strong> they are ways of trying to maximize happiness!</strong><br>
		  <br>
		  What  happens is that organisms that own nervous system are ALWAYS running from  suffering and seeking pleasure. All the time. As pleasure multiplied by time is  happiness, to put it simple, organisms are always seeking pleasure. And the  genes, on the other hand, always &ldquo;want&rdquo; to survive, to perpetuate. In our  evolutionary past, at least, the ways to seek happiness should be the same that  led to gene-perpetuation. That is: the more happiness we got, the more genetic  perpetuation would be done. Therefore <em>we  have a logical-evolutionary correlation between seek for happiness and genetic  perpetuation.</em><br>
		  <br>
  <strong>Betrayal</strong><br>
  <br>
		  Nevertheless,  the genes &ldquo;did not know&rdquo; that such rational power and ability to control from  something flexible as the consciousness they had created and its associated  neuronal subsystems could also turn against themselves. Although consciousness can  solve technical problems masterfully in a way to avoid pain and get pleasure,  has also allowed harmful memes to perpetuate genetically (for instance  consumerism and VM2F) and also harmful to happiness (Buddhism, celibacism, etc) to appear.<br>
		  <br>
		  Obviously,  we are still in an evolutionary process. Natural selection continues to act in  a way that, in a long or short term, those memes will face barriers, if not  memetic, at least genetic against their proliferation. One of the ways for the  genes to get rid of the &nbsp;VM2F is to  instigate an organism to reproduce before a meme is installed in its mind. That  should explain the increase in numbers of teenage pregnancies [3].<br>
		  <br>
  <strong>Priorities Hierarchization </strong><br>
  <br>
		  One  of the things Genismo suggests is that we must follow our genes. But what does  that mean?<br>
		  It  basically means that we must act according to what &ldquo;our genes want&rdquo;.<br>
		  One  of the ways the genes signalize what they want is through wills and wishes. For  instance, if an organism feels the need for water, genetic mechanisms signalize  with thirst. If the organism satiates the thirst it will be acting according to  the wills of the genes that created the mechanism of thirst. However, there  could also be conflicting wills. For instance, I may feel like eating candy  and, at the same time, I may want to lose weight and be healthy. How can I  prioritize that? What if a gene-perpetuative action is anti-ethical?<br>
		  The  best way to solve those conflicts is through a priorities hierarchy. See below what  I propose:</p>
		<ol>
		  <li><em>Scientific Meta Ethics should be the greatest hierarchical valued rule.</em></li>
		  </ol>
		<p>This  way, not even gene-perpetuative actions are allowed if they infringe SME.</p>
		<ol>
		  <li><em>The gene-perpetuative path must be prioritized in relation to satisfaction  of wills and wishes.</em></li>
		  <li><em>Satisfaction of wills and wishes is a way of following the genes.</em></li>
		  </ol>
		<p>Through  this hierarchy, &ldquo;pragmatic-Genismo&rdquo;, which used to be based on hedonism as a  way of maximizing pleasure without necessarily a counterpart in perpetuation of  genes, now is not genistically compatible anymore in case the action is against  gene-perpetuation.<br>
		  <br>
            <strong>Maximization of Happiness</strong><br>
            <br>
		  It  is easy now to notice, through priorities hierarchization, that the goal of Genismo,  by definition, is the maximization of happiness in the first place, since SME  has maximization of happiness as a basic postulate:<br>
		  <br>
          <em>&ldquo;Scientific  Meta Ethics postulates that an action is better or fairer than another one when  the level of general happiness created from it, computed in the longest period  of time possible, is superior to the level of happiness created in the same  period.&rdquo;</em> [5]</p>
		<p><strong>Happiness among Genists and non-Genists</strong><br>
		  <br>
		  Genismo  makes cultural goal compatible with the &ldquo;biological goal&rdquo;. This way, Genists  have an extra <em>ideological pleasure</em> for knowing that they are acting in a gene-perpetuative way, even if this  action also causes pleasure naturally, which is in general sponsored by genes  when one follows the gene-perpetuative path.<br>
		  <br>
		  On  the other hand non-genists, especially the ones who are not interested in  gene-perpetuation, will not always follow a gene-perpetuative path, and most  regularly a diversion from this path will make one suffer or at least prevent  one from being as happy as one could be when following it.</p>
		<p>In  natural conditions, a non-genist has two options:</p>
		<ol>
		  <li>The individual does not follow any ideology, religion or life  philosophy.</li>
		  </ol>
		<p>In  that case the person must follow what gives him/her more pleasure, that is, the  person will follow his/her instincts aiming happiness, what would be more or  less like the genist pillar that says we must follow our genes. It is like  returning to our primitive origins but within a modern environment. That could  probably lead to a gene-perpetuative path, but not necessarily!</p>
		<ol>
		  <li>The individual follows some ideology, religion or philosophy of life.</li>
		  </ol>
		<p>In  case those philosophies are not Genismo, the person will have to restrict or  act in a way that does not favors genes and, for that reason, he/she will at  some moment repress genes, what should cause loss of happiness. For example:  some religions promote physical sacrifices like whipping and boring prayers to  please God. But those sacrifices decrease physical pleasure and therefore  happiness, though they can cause ideological pleasure.<br>
		  <br>
		  However,  a genist has ideological pleasure without having to stray from the  gene-perpetuative rout. That way he/she would have a greater happiness than a  non-genist with no ideology or a non-genist with ideology. This way we  demonstrate that following Genismo produces more happiness than not following  it.<br>
		  <br>
  <strong>The Matrix Case</strong><br>
  <br>
		  The  matrixian case is an extremely artificial chance of maximization of individual  happiness at the expense of maximum alienation of the world and the universe.  As follows:<br>
		  Suppose  a person wants to maximize his/her personal happiness and enters a matrixian cocoon  where electrodes are implanted in his/her brain and he/she will receive  intravenous feeding, in a way that he/she will spend the rest of his/her life  in this machine that maximizes happiness.<br>
		  By  definition, the machine will maximize happiness to the highest level his/her  brain can handle. Happiness will be maximized as it would never be in the real  world. This person will not perpetuate any genes and will consume many planet  resources in order to stay in that machine for years.<br>
		  Now  I ask the reader a difficult question: would you enter this matrixian machine  if it was offered to you cost-free? And if not, why not?<br>
		  If your answer is yes it is because there is already gene-perpetuative  spark acting in you! &#61514;&nbsp;<br>
