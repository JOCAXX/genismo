		  <strong><em>&quot;Love is an instinct, programmed into us by our genes in order to do the Quality Control of the person who may be the parent of our children.&quot; (Jocax) </em></strong></p>
        
		</font>
		<p><br>
  From this we conclude that: </p>
		<p><strong><br>
  1-Love is an instinct. </strong></p>
		<p><br>
  Love is an instinct. This means that love is not directly controlled by our conscious will. I must emphasize that instinct (the way I herein talk about it) means desires, impulses or reflections, in short, mental algorithms, which are molded into our brains by a prescription encoded in our genes. An instinct may sometimes be molded by the environment, that is, its action also depends on the circumstances in which the organism is inserted. They are known as epigenetic rules. Anyway, instincts are beyond our conscious control; we cannot choose what we feel, when we feel or for whom we feel. </p>
		<p><br>
  Love being an instinct, that implies it is also hereditary. But it does not mean that the object of love is determined exclusively by genetics. As I said before, mental algorithms can be modulated by the environment, that is local culture may fix some values ??that will influence mental algorithms in determining the beloved object. I believe, however, that most of the traits that influence love are genetically determined. Some traits are always appreciated, regardless of culture or time, for example, beauty, intelligence, character, health will always have a strong influence on the degree of love, but the proportion of each trait necessary to trigger the instinct - and make the person love - varies from person to person and must be determined genetically. </p>
		<p><br>
&nbsp;2-Love is an instinct for <strong>quality control </strong>. </p>
		<p><br>
  Many still believe that the &quot;goal&quot; of living beings is to perpetuate the species. It is not. The goal of every living being is to perpetuate genes, its own genes. </p>
		<p><br>
  To perpetuate means surviving through time, across generations. That means the quality of the bearer of genes is essential. Our genes will combine to the ones of the opposite sex and form another being. If the genes that will combine to ours in our children do not have &quot;quality&quot; enough, our genes will not survive the time and that means not surviving to competition with other individuals, or not attracting sexual partners to have children or even not having good partners. Thus, quality control is necessary for the genes to maintain their &quot;intent&quot; of immortality. </p>
		<p><br>
  Moreover, the quality of the offspring is not only due to the partner's genes. It is not profitable to have many descendants if they do not survive a single generation because they are not physically or culturally prepared. Therefore, there is a compromise between quality and quantity. In general, the higher the number, the lower is the quality. The inverse is also true: the fewer children, the greater the care and investment &quot;per capita&quot; and therefore the higher the quality of each, increasing the possibility for genes to go through generations. </p>
		<p><br>
  In short: Love serves as a quality filter for us to make a good choice of the partner you can mix your genes with through children. <br>
&nbsp; <br>
  3 - <strong>The goal of love is to generate children </strong>. </p>
		<p><br>
  The aim of love is to generate children because it is through children that genes jump from one generation to another in their &quot;search&quot; for immortality. That explains the direct ratio between love and sexuality, libido, between love and wanting one always near, jealousy. Jealousy is a form of ensuring, and mainly keeping the beloved partner as a future provider of gametes (eggs / sperm) that will unite to our genes. It is also the reason why oldness is so feared by women: men will instinctively prefer younger women, at reproductive age (even if they do not consciously want to have children), and this is perceived by women who will desperately struggle &quot;against&quot; oldness. </p>
		<p><br>
  That is why aging in men is not as tragic as it has psychologically been for women: men have almost double the fertile period that a woman does, so they do not suffer the same selective pressure by the opposite sex as women do. </p>
		<p><br>
  For this reason we do not fall in love with (at least apparently) high quality people, as muses of great beauty or famous artists: although they seem to have great genes, they would be far beyond our real possibilities and then the instincts are not fooled by illusions that may not generate children. <br>
&nbsp; <br>
  2.0 - <strong>Passion according to Jocax </strong></p>
		<p><br>
  Passion is a form of love. Passion is the feeling of love in an extreme degree, and almost always mixed with great imagination. </p>
		<p><br>
  Passion is characterized by the obsessive desire for the beloved one. This obsession often happens because, not knowing all the aspects of the beloved one, those aspects are filled by the imagination of the person in love. </p>
		<p><br>
  That is why many times the passion fades away as suddenly as it came: when the imagined aspects are replaced by the real ones, which not always correspond to those previously imagined. That normally happens as the person gets to know for real the beloved object. </p>
		<p><br>
  Nevertheless (but rarely) the reverse can also happen when the characteristics initially imagined are confirmed by the time: passion is then consolidated as an enduring love. </p>
		<p><br>
  As a form of love, passion also seeks genetic perpetuation, and therefore it is also a feeling connected to sexual desire. Like love, passion measures the genetic quality of the beloved being; however the estimated quality is not always true, because it is mixed with imaginary aspects. </p>
		<p><br>
  Therefore, it is not impossible to replace a beloved one by another one, since this other one may have more qualities than the first one, and therefore the target of passion could switch its destination. </p>
		<p><br>
  Passion is dangerous because, bringing along imaginary aspects, one is at risk of taking wrong decisions. On the other hand, it might be the only way for excessively shy people to have children. </p>
		<p><br>
  Thus, I believe passion will be greater and more frequent according to how shy the person is. This is due to the fact that if shyness is genetic, the only way for the person to feel free and get involved would be through a more powerful feeling. </p>
		<p><br>
  Passion, as a type of love, is also related to the generation of children, and because of that, old men very commonly fall in love with younger women at a high fertility age: the man's genes “notice” that there will be high probabilities of perpetuating themselves. Passion then settles so that the body can chase the gene-perpetuating target. Note, however, that there must be some kind of reception by the young woman for that to happen, since if a woman does not give any indication of receptivity to the man, the instincts notice a &quot;zero chance of copulation&quot; and may give up &quot;owning&quot; the body with passion. Therefore, cases of passion between old men and much younger women are predictable and real, but for them to happen, as in all cases, the woman must provide some indication of possibility of intercourse with the men. </p>
