		<p><strong>Summary</strong>: <em>We will establish a philosophical scientific  principle similar to Heisenberg&rsquo;s uncertainty principle, but more  comprehensive.</em><br>
		  <br>
            <strong>Key Words</strong>: <em>Philosophy, Uncertainty, PUP, Philosophical  Uncertainty Principle.</em><br>
<br>
Quantum mechanics, a branch of Physics that study the  micro cosmos, has a fundamental principle known as &ldquo;Uncertainty Principle&rdquo;.  This principle, discovered by Heisenberg, establishes the physical  impossibility of knowing (or measuring), simultaneously, the position and speed  of a particle with a precision larger than a given constant [1]. This  imprecision is considered to be a fundamental law in quantum mechanics, and  such uncertainty does not depend on any technology, it is considered to be an  attribute of the universe.<br>
<br>
Since the advent of the &ldquo;Expanded Science&rdquo; [2], we  know it is impossible to refute a theory as Popper thought. Everything  indicated a more comprehensive and less uncertain view of the universe. Such  uncertainty must comprehend our observations. Based on these conclusions, I  shall propose a principle, which I called &ldquo;Philosophical Uncertainty  Principle&rdquo;, or PUP. <br>
		</p>
		</font><p>	    The PUP establishes that:</p>
		<p><font size="3" face="Arial">&ldquo;<strong>It is impossible to know if some observation, measure  or perception corresponds in fact to reality</strong>&rdquo;.</font></p>
		<p><font size="3" face="Arial">		  We can take reality as something that exists  regardless of any interpretation, processing or imagination.<br>
		  <br>
		  Many should probably have already had this idea, but  have not formalized it yet because, since the advent of the concept of &ldquo;Solipsism&rdquo;  [3], we know it is impossible to prove that anything can be in fact reality.  And worse than that, even the Solipsism itself can be an illusion, since the  &ldquo;I&rdquo; that realizes can also be unreal, as shown in &ldquo;The Existence Theorem (I think, therefore it  exists)&rdquo; [4]. That is, it is possible that the &ldquo;being&rdquo; itself that observes  thinks and feels, does not exist in another level of interpretation. 
          <br>
          <br>		  Besides that, and more important, even if we assumed  our reality as real, that is, it exists regardless of any interpretation of a  higher level as it is supposed by science, we would still have problems: even  so we could not take any observation as real. In order to understand that, we  must steal the &ldquo;shoe box&rdquo; example from the essay &ldquo;Expanded Science&rdquo; [2]:<br>
		  <br>
		  Suppose we are walking on the street and we observe a  shoe box with a brick inside. Can we infer from our observation that what we  saw was a shoe box with a brick inside? Unfortunately the answer is no. In  principle, one of the following situations can occur &ndash; from infinite possible ones  &ndash; when we observe a brick that is not a brick: It was the volume of a  radio imitating a brick.</p>
		<ul><li>It was something similar  to a brick, but not a brick.</li>
		  <li>A momentary cerebral  short-circuit made you imagine a brick inside an empty box.</li>
		  <li>A new alpha-waves gun was  tested on you so you could imagine the brick.</li>
		  <li>Someone created a  holographic image of the brick so you would think it was real.</li>
		  <li>Etc</li>
		  </ul>
		  
		<p>Such mistakes, although improbable, can happen  in any level of observation, be it scientific or not. And that justifies PUP as  a fundamental philosophic-scientific principle about the limit of knowledge.</p>
