		<p><strong><em>1 &ndash; What is the&nbsp;Jocaxian&nbsp;Nothingness (JN)?</em></strong> </p>
		</font>
		<p>A: The JN, differently  from existent things, presents the following properties:<br>
		  P1- There&nbsp;are&nbsp;no  physical elements of any kind (matter, space or energy).<br>
		  P2-&nbsp;There&nbsp;are&nbsp;no  laws of any kind.</p>
		<p><strong><em>2- Does the JN exist?</em></strong> <br>
		  A: We can only say that  the JN exists in case something&nbsp;that  has the properties of a JN (P1 and P2 above) exists. Nowadays, the JN does not  exist anymore, but it could have existed in a distant past, before the  Big-Bang.</p>
		<p><strong><em>3- Is the JN  being?</em></strong> <br>
		  A: Yes. Once it has  properties, it should exist in order to be a recipient of such properties.</p>
		<p><strong><em>4-&nbsp;Could&nbsp; the</em></strong>&nbsp;<strong><em>Jocaxian-Nothingness feature of not having any rules  or laws be&nbsp;a rule&nbsp;itself?</em></strong> <br>
		  A: No. A rule  establishes some kind of restriction. For instance: &ldquo;my car must be red&rdquo; is a  rule, but &ldquo;my car is red&rdquo; is not a rule, but&nbsp;the&nbsp;state&nbsp;of the car.&nbsp;Occasionally, the car could be painted  blue.&nbsp;Establishing that the&nbsp;&ldquo;Jocaxian&nbsp;Nothingness&rdquo; is the&nbsp;state of nature in which there are no  rules is not a rule that must be followed, but&nbsp;also&nbsp;a  state of nature that could change&nbsp;(or  not).</p>
		<p><strong><em>5-&nbsp;Would saying&nbsp;that anything can happen be a rule?&nbsp;An imposition to&nbsp;the</em></strong>&nbsp;<strong><em>Jocaxian&nbsp;Nothingness?</em></strong> <br>
		  A: Yes. However, if you&nbsp;look at the text I emphasize that in  the&nbsp;Jocaxian&nbsp;Nothingness anything can happen OR  NOT. This is not a rule, but a logical tautology, an absolute truth in any  circumstances or scenarios. That implies that the&nbsp;Jocaxian&nbsp;Nothingness,&nbsp;just like anything, follows a  tautology (an absolute truth), not a rule.</p>
		<p><strong><em>6- The&nbsp;Jocaxian&nbsp;Nothingness does not have&nbsp;physical elements</em></strong>&nbsp;<strong><em>or laws. Does it have any POTENTIAL?</em></strong> <br>
		  A: If &ldquo;potential&rdquo; means  the possibility of transforming itself, the answer is yes. However, we must&nbsp;bear&nbsp;in  mind that possibility is not&nbsp;certainty.  The&nbsp;Jocaxian&nbsp;Nothingness could eventually never  become or generate something else.</p>
		<p><strong><em>7- Would&nbsp;the Trivial Nothingness, where nothing  can happen, be more likely than the &ldquo;JN&rdquo;?</em></strong> <br>
		  A: No! The nothingness  people usually think of, which I called &ldquo;the&nbsp;trivial  nothingness&rdquo; (TN) is infinitely more unlikely to happen as the origin of the  universe than the JN.&nbsp;The&nbsp;&ldquo;trivial nothingness&rdquo; would have  INFINITE&nbsp;embedded&nbsp;rules that must&nbsp;be&nbsp;followed,&nbsp;i.e. it could not generate fields,  space, it could not generate a chair; it&nbsp;could  not&nbsp;generate physical laws,&nbsp;god,&nbsp;a  Big-Bang, life, particles, etc.</p>
		<p><strong><em>8 &ndash; Is the &ldquo;Inexistent  Nothingness&rdquo;&nbsp;purer than the JN?</em></strong> <br>
		  A: The Inexistent  Nothingness is a &ldquo;nothingness&rdquo; where nothing exists, not even itself!<br>
		  Therefore, it is&nbsp;intrinsically contradictory. Since it  does not exist, it could not have properties, but once it has the &ldquo;not having  anything&rdquo; property, it should exist.&nbsp;Thus,  if the &ldquo;IN&rdquo; exists, it cannot be inexistent, and if it is inexistent, it cannot  exist.&nbsp;It is a contradiction, and&nbsp;that is why&nbsp;it was not used as&nbsp;the&nbsp;generator  of the cosmos.</p>
		<p><strong><em>9 &ndash; What is the  difference between the &ldquo;Universe&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Cosmos&rdquo;?</em></strong> <br>
		  A: The Universe is the  aggregation of everything that exists. Thus, each possible&nbsp;&ldquo;Bubble&nbsp;Universe&rdquo; or &ldquo;Multi-Universe&rdquo;&nbsp;is, in fact, part&nbsp;of the same Universe. That is why it  is more correct to name each &ldquo;Bubble Universe&rdquo;&nbsp;as&nbsp;&ldquo;Bubble  Cosmos&rdquo;. Therefore, a Cosmos would be a place in the universe governed by its  own physical laws, isolated and with no interconnection with other cosmos.</p>
		<p><strong><em>10- Is the JN the  Universe or has the JN originated the Universe?</em></strong> <br>
		  A:&nbsp;If we understand the definition of the  Universe as being the aggregation of all that exists, the JN would be the  universe itself. It would be the universe in its minimal state, the simplest&nbsp;state possible. Therefore, the JN  could not originate the universe, since it is the universe itself, where time  does not exist. Later it could have&nbsp;materialized  randomly&nbsp;one or more cosmos.</p>
		<p><strong><em>11- Is the JN limited to  our logic? Could it be illogical?</em></strong> <br>
		  A: There are two&nbsp;interrelated&nbsp;concepts about the&nbsp;Jocaxian&nbsp;Nothingness: The&nbsp;Jocaxian&nbsp;Nothingness Object (JN-Object) and the  Theory about this JN-Object (JN-Theory). The JN-Object is defined as something  that has properties relative to the JN (P1 and P2) above. The theory about the  JN (JN-Theory) is based on logic and&nbsp;explains&nbsp;how the JN-Object&nbsp;could have materialized&nbsp;our cosmos&nbsp;at random.&nbsp;It is possible to say that the  JN-Object does not have laws therefore it does not need to obey logic, and is  it correct, indeed. However, by analyzing the JN-Object from&nbsp;our classic logic, we are not  attaching new possibilities to the JN-Object, but the opposite: we could, in  fact, be limiting the possibilities of the JN-Object which&nbsp;means,&nbsp;maybe it could be more&nbsp;totipotent&nbsp;than we can imagine.</p>
		<p><strong><em>12- Is the JN no longer  a JN in case it&nbsp;have&nbsp;materialized something randomly,  therefore losing&nbsp;the&nbsp;capacity of doing it?</em></strong> <br>
		  A: The materializations  of the JN are called &ldquo;schizo-creations&rdquo;. The Universe was in a JN form.&nbsp;When the&nbsp;first&nbsp;schizo-creation&nbsp;of&nbsp;the  JN&nbsp;happens,&nbsp;it means that&nbsp;the&nbsp;JN&nbsp;cannot be the JN&nbsp;anymore, as now the universe has at  least one element: its first&nbsp;schizo-creation.  In case this&nbsp;schizo-creation is  not a law&nbsp;that prevents&nbsp;the universe from materializing other  things, like&nbsp;a law&nbsp;that transforms&nbsp;it into a trivial nothingness,&nbsp;then this&nbsp;schizo-creation,&nbsp;which is the evolved JN (EJN),&nbsp;could&nbsp;occasionally continue to generate&nbsp;schizo-creations.&nbsp; Only the  generation of laws that restrict the generation of laws could prevent new&nbsp;schizo-creations.</p>
		<p><strong><em>13- Is it possible to  isolate a portion of the cosmos and transform it in a JN?</em></strong> </p>
		<p>A: Hardly. Since our  cosmos is&nbsp;flooded&nbsp;with physical laws, in order to create  a JN it would be necessary to withdraw all the physical laws from that portion.  No one knows&nbsp;yet&nbsp;if it is possible or how it could be  done.</p>
		<p><strong><em>14- Is it necessary to  sort laws temporally in order to have a natural selection of laws? That is, would time be a prerequisite?</em></strong> <br>
		  A:&nbsp;It would not be a big problem in case&nbsp;we needed&nbsp;some &ldquo;time law&rdquo; or &ldquo;time&rdquo; itself&nbsp;to sort laws materialized by the JN.&nbsp;It would be enough&nbsp;only&nbsp;to  &ldquo;wait&rdquo; that one of the&nbsp;schizo-creations&nbsp;was&nbsp;a  temporal law.&nbsp;Thereafter new&nbsp;laws would be sorted and&nbsp;undergo&nbsp;the &ldquo;natural selection&rdquo;.</p>
		<p><strong><em>15- What is the evidence  that our cosmos came from a JN?</em></strong> <br>
		  A: The evidence would be  a logical universe where there are no physical contradictions between its  physical elements.</p>
