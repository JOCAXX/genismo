        <div align="justify"><p>The  &ldquo;Jocaxian Nothingness&rdquo; (JN) is the &ldquo;Nothingness&rdquo; that exists. It is a physical  system devoid not only of physical elements and physical laws, but also of  rules of any kind.<br>
          <br>
In  order to understand and intuit JN as an &ldquo;existent nothingness&rdquo;, we can mentally  build it as follows: we withdraw all the matter, energy and the field they  generate from the universe. Then we can withdraw dark energy and dark matter.  What is left is something that is not the nonexistent. Let us continue our  mental experiment and suppress elements of the universe: now, we withdraw  physical laws and spatial dimensions. If we do not forget to withdraw anything,  what is left is a JN: an existent nothingness.<br>
<br>
JN  is different from the Nothingness we generally think of. The commonly believed  nothingness, which we might call &ldquo;Trivial Nothingness&rdquo; to distinguish it from  the JN, is something from which nothing can arise, that is, the &ldquo;Trivial  Nothing&rdquo; follows a rule: &ldquo;Nothing can happen&rdquo;. Thus, the &ldquo;Trivial Nothingness&rdquo;,  the nothingness people generally think of when talking about &ldquo;nothingness&rdquo;, is  not the simplest possible nothingness, it has at least one restriction rule.<br>
<br>
Jocax  did not define the JN as something in which nothing exists. Such definition is  dubious and contains some contradictions as: &ldquo;If in the nothingness nothing  exists, then, nothingness itself does not exist&rdquo;. No. First, Jocax defined what  it means to exist: &ldquo;Something exists when its properties are fulfilled within  reality&rdquo;. Therefore, JN has been defined as something that:</p>
		  <ol>
		    <li><em>Has no physical elements of any kind (particles, energy, space, etc.)</em></li>
	      </ol>
		  <ol>
		    <li><em>Has no laws (mainly the law embedded in &ldquo;Trivial Nothingness&rdquo;).</em></li>
	      </ol>
		  <p>Being  so, JN could have physically existed. JN is a construction that differs from the  &ldquo;trivial nothingness&rdquo; since it does not contain the rule &ldquo;Nothing can happen&rdquo;.  That way, Jocax liberates his JN from semantic paradoxes like: &ldquo;If it exists,  then it does not exist&rdquo; and claims that this nothingness is SOMETHING that  could have existed. That is, JN is the simplest possible physical structure,  something like the minimal state of nature. And also the natural candidate for  the origin of the universe.<br>
		    <br>
		    We  must not confuse the definition of the NJ with rules to be followed. It is only  the declaration of a state. If nature is in the state defined by conditions 1  and 2 above, we say it is a &ldquo;Jocaxian-Nothingness&rdquo;. The state of a system is  something that can change, differently from the rule that must be followed by  the system (otherwise it would not be a rule). For example, the state &ldquo;has no  physical elements&rdquo;; it is a state, not a rule because, occasionally this state  may change. If it was a rule it could not change (unless another rule  eliminated the first one).<br>
		    <br>
		    Being  free of any elements, JN does not presume the existence of any existing thing  but its own and, by the &ldquo;Occam&rsquo;s Razor&rdquo; [2], it must be the simplest state  possible of nature, therefore with no need for explanations about its origin.  JN, of course, does not currently exist, but may have existed in a distant  past. That is, JN would be the universe itself &ndash; defined as a set of all  existing things &ndash; in its minimal state. Thus we can also say the Universe  (being a JN) has always existed.<br>
		    <br>
		    JN,  as well as everything that can be understood by means of logic, must follow the  tautology: &ldquo;it may or may NOT happen&rdquo;. This tautology &ndash; absolute logical truth  &ndash; as we shall see, has also a semantic value in JN: it allows things to happen  (or not).<br>
		    <br>
		    We  cannot say that events in the JN must necessarily occur. Eventually, it is  possible that nothing really happens, that is, JN may continue &ldquo;indefinitely&rdquo;  (time does not exist in a JN) without changing its initial state and with no occurrences.  But there is a possibility that random phenomena can derive from this absolute  nothingness. This conclusion comes logically from the analysis of a system  without premises: as JN, by definition, does not have laws, it can be <em>shaped</em> as a logical system without premises.<br>
		    <br>
		    We  shall interrupt a little in order to open up an explanatory digression. We are  dealing with two types of &ldquo;Jocaxian-Nothingness&rdquo;: the physical object named  &ldquo;JN&rdquo;, which was the universe in its minimal state with the properties described  above; and the theory which analyses this object, the JN-Theory. The JN-Theory,  the theory about the JN-object (this text), uses logical rules to help us  understand the JN-Object. But JN-object itself does not follow logical rules,  once there are no laws it must obey. Nevertheless, I do not believe we will let  possibilities to JN-object escape if we analyze it according to classic logic.  However, we must be aware that this logical analysis (JN-Theory) could maybe  limit some potentiality of JN-Object.<br>
		    <br>
		    Within  a system without premises, we cannot conclude that something cannot happen.  There are no laws from which we can draw this conclusion. That is, there is no  prohibition for anything to happen. If there is no prohibition for anything to  happen, then, eventually, something may happen. That is, the tautological  logics remain true in a system without premises: &ldquo;something happens or not&rdquo;. If  something occasionally happens, this something must not obey rules and,  therefore, would be totally random and unpredictable.<br>
		    <br>
		    [<em>All  of this may sound really weird, and it actually is. But I can put clear  evidence that JN is not an absurd: first, go search the following on a search  engine on the Internet: &ldquo;virtual particles&rdquo; or singular &ldquo;virtual particle&rdquo;.  Virtual particles occur in our universe as spontaneous creation from the  quantum vacuum, from one particle and its anti-particle. Science considers the  generation of this pair of particles an event without physical causes,  something genuinely random. This is a scientific fact and can be explained by  quantum mechanics. Now, let us move a bit from the facts and imagine each one  of these particles contains a tiny miniature universe. That way, in this mental  experience, we have a clue, a little evidence that the emergence of a universe  out of nothing is so out of purpose as we could once believe&hellip;</em>]<br>
		    <br>
		    We  call the first JN randomizations <em>Schizo-Creations</em>.  This <em>schizo-creations</em>, once they come  from something without laws, are totally random and, if we could watch them,  they would seem completely &ldquo;schizophrenic&rdquo;.&nbsp;  Of course with the first randomizations, JN is no longer the original JN  as now it owns something, that is, the JN transforms. Because JN is not limited  by any laws, it may eventually also generate laws, to which its elements - now itself &ndash; would have to obey.<br>
		    <br>
	      Let  us show how the random generation of laws can produce a logical universe:  suppose laws are generated randomly in a sequence. If a new law is generated  and does not conflict with the others, all of them remain undamaged in the set  of generated laws. However, if a law that conflicts with other laws previously  generated appears, it replaces (kills) the previous laws that are inconsistent  with it, since it must be obeyed (until a newer law opposes to it). Thus, in a true &ldquo;natural selection&rdquo;  of laws, only a little set of laws compatible to each other would last. That  answers a fundamental philosophical question about our universe: &ldquo;Why does the  universe follow logical rules?&rdquo;</p>
		  
		  Thereby, the Jocaxian Nothingness is the natural  candidate for the origin of the universe, since it is the simplest possible state  nature could present: a state of such simplicity there would not be the need to  explain its existence. And, by logical consequence of this state, anything  could be (or not) randomized, even our physical laws and elementary particles.</div>
